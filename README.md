# Example Measurement While Drilling (MWD) File in DIGGS Format

Welcome to the repository containing an example of raw MWD data converted into the DIGGS (Drilling Industry Geotechnical Data Exchange Standard) file format. This repository serves as a demonstration of the conversion process and provides insights into the structure of MWD data in DIGGS format.

## Overview

Measurement While Drilling (MWD) is a technique used in drilling operations to provide real-time data about the borehole, including direction, inclination, and other parameters. This repository contains an example of raw MWD data obtained during a drilling operation, along with its conversion into the DIGGS format.

## Contents

- **Raw Data:** The `3_11_B-2.guh` file contains an example of raw MWD data in structured text format.
- **Converted DIGGS File:** The `converted_data.diggs` file contains the same data converted into the DIGGS format.

## Usage

To view the raw MWD data and the corresponding DIGGS file, simply navigate to the respective files in this repository.

To utilize the conversion process for your own MWD data:
1. Ensure your raw MWD data is in a structured text format similar to the provided example.
2. Utilize the conversion script provided in the `convert.py` file to convert your data into the DIGGS format.
3. Customize the conversion script as per your specific data format and requirements.
